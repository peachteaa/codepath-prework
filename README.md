2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was getting accustomed through GitHub. Since this was my first experience using this application, it was very confusing at first.  I have always heard of Github through peers but never had the chance to create an account due to pursuing studies and never had the time to create one. So when I found out that we needed to use Github I was confused right away. Thankfully the provided videos during the pre worked helped out a lot guiding me on what to each step of the way. One encounter was editing the README.md file. At first I initially thought I had to create another readme file and had to restart all over again. Thankfully I didn't and realize the readme file can be opened and edited until I opened the file that needed to be to changed for this pre-work. Another encounter I had with the submission was recording the project into a gif. I tried accessing through QuickTime but for some reason it led me to no luck. This lead to me downloading Recordit and create my recordings into gifs that way. It is quite ironic how I found creating the light and sound game to be quite straightforward but the submissions to submit the project itself was quite troublesome.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Prior to this pre-assessment, I through web development seemed quite easy in theory. Then the realization quickly hit on how meticulous web development can be. Despite that this pre work assemement lead me to many questions. One major question is there must be certain roles  for areas when it comes to making a website. One person can not be the only one working on one website alone once realizing how meticulous creating a simple game can be. For web development, does the function of the application or website weigh more than the design aspect. It feels like both function and design play a key role but does functionality outweigh design heavily or are they sort of equivalent when it comes to importance?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Adding more features to the light and sound game would be my top priority if I had more time. One of the features I initially wanted to include was a strike method. If the user clicked on the wrong button it would show an indicator on the screen that they have a certain of number of strikes. More specifically I would place the indicator next to my start and stop button. I think this would add a nice safety net if the user accidently miss clicks. Another feature I would have wanted to add is to make the user choose two difficulties: easy or hard. An easy difficulty would probably be showing the sequence slowly and include the strike method as mentioned above. The hard difficulty can not include the strike method, have faster sequence showing, and maybe a timer. I feel like adding a choice of difficulty can add some sort of control the user can have playing the game.
